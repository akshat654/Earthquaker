# QuakeSafe 
An Application for Earthquakes 
The Concept:
Earthquakes are the most expensive natural disasters humans face. A strong earthquake in the wrong place at the wrong time can cause great financial damage and cost tens of thousands of human lives. People panic during such tragedies and randomly follow the mob which is sometimes deadly as they may not be heading in the right direction and are always in need of an alternative source to confirm the safest nearby location. Also, people try to know the well-being of their dear ones through whatever platform is available to them, but the use of such platforms by others about whom we want to know is not guaranteed during such a situation. 
There are many solutions available online for finding the safe places consisting of only the open regions in google maps but we all know that open regions like parks, grounds are not the only safe locations when it comes to an earthquake, keeping in mind the unavailability, absence and distance of such open locations from our current location. 
As in the case of metropolitan cities, we don’t get to see open areas a lot. So, there is a need to shift our focus from grounds and parks to safer locations in case of metropolitan cities. 
The major cause of injuries during an earthquake is the collapse of buildings. So, if somehow we are able to find the danger radius of a building, i.e., upto what distance from it people shouldn’t be there, it would be a great lead towards saving the lives of people. The danger radius of building can be approximated keeping in mind various factors, the most important one being height. Now, once we get the height we’ll be able to approximate the danger radius of a building. 
We have acquired the height data of a specific region from Microsoft US Building Footprints data, that is of the Delaware region in US.
